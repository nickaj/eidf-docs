# Overview

The EIDF Virtual Machine Service (VMS) is one of the underlying infrastructure components upon which the EIDF Data Science Cloud (DSC) is built. It hosts both user and infrastructure Virtual Machines (VMs).

The service currently has a mixture of [hardware](hardware.md) node types which host VMs of various [flavours](flavours.md):

## Service Access

Users should have an EIDF account - [EIDF Accounts](../../access/project.md).

Project Leads will be able to have the VMS added to their project during the project application process or through a request to the EIDF helpdesk.

Access to user VMs is avaiable via [command line SSH](../../access/ssh.md), or [Virtual Desktop Inferface (VDI)](../../access/virtualmachines-vdi.md) via a browser.

## Service Policy Information

Important information on service policies can be found [here](policies.md).
